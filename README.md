# Project Vettius Browser Extension
### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Project Vettius is a browser extension that allows you to generate Astrology articles written in the style of 2nd Century Roman Astrologer Vettius Valens.

Project Vettius DOES work at this time, and I aim to broaden is functionalities. 
As of right now, Project Vettius is NOT available on Chrome Web Store, so it must be imported manually. 
Also, it only works on Calmly Writer (https://www.calmlywriter.com/online/).

Here are the instructions on how to INSTALL the extension.

1. You MUST have OpenAI API credits, if you do not have an account with them, you can sign up https://openai.com/product.
2. Clone the repository and go to brave://extensions/.
3. At brave://extensions/ select 'LOAD UNPACKED'.
4. Select the folder containing Project Vettius.
5. Once you have loaded the extension, you can now activate it.

How to USE the extension once it's installed:

1. Press the Extension's Icon
2. Input your API Key
3. Write a prompt which you would like the extension to expound upon. [It must be specific to Traditional Astrology.]
4. Highlight the text
5. Right click and select "Generate blog post."

If the post does not generate, if you have not done so, remain on the page until the post generates. It may take a few minutes to generate upon first use, or if you're returning to it after some time.

NOTE: The sliders do NOT work at this time.

Thank you!
